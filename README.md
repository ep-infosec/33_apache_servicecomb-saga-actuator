## Purpose
Saga is a type of Compensating Transaction pattern, which provides a simple way to help users solve the data consistency problems encountered in micro-service applications. 
Saga actuator provides a centralized execution engine to delegate the request to the outside services to provide eventual data consistency in Saga way. 

## Documentation
Reference documentation is available on the [ServiceComb website](http://servicecomb.io/).

## Major Architecture of Saga
* saga-core(transaction and compensation handling logic)
* saga-core-akka(leverage the actor for executor)
* saga-format(data serialization and deserialization)
* saga-transports(communication protocol implementation such as rest or rpc in the future)
* saga-discovery(service discovery)
* saga-spring(restful service framework)
